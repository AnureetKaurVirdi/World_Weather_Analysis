# World_Weather_Analysis

#### The purpose of this project is to collect, analyze and visualize weather data across the cities worldwide and to provide travelers with a tool that will allow them to find their travel destinations based on weather conditions they like. This project consisted of creating a weather database with a set of random 2,000 latitudes and longitudes and making an API call on current weather data for their nearest corresponding cities. The next step was to create a vacation search based on traverler's weather preferences, so that they can identify their destinations by looking at all the factors. Some other aspects of this analysis included preliminary statistical analysis by making scatter plots and performing Linear Regression on Northern and Southern Hemispheres.
